# Exchange Filter Enhancement - Country Flags & Short Names

## What's New

The search filters now display exchange names with country flags and shortened names for better readability and visual appeal.

## Examples

Instead of showing:
- "New York Stock Exchange"
- "London Stock Exchange" 
- "Tokyo Stock Exchange"

The filters now show:
- 🇺🇸 NYSE
- 🇬🇧 LSE  
- 🇯🇵 TSE

## Features

### Country Flag Mapping
- **40+ countries** supported with flag emojis
- **Fallback** to 🏢 building emoji for unknown countries
- **Comprehensive coverage** of major global exchanges

### Short Name Generation
- **Intelligent mapping** for common exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, LSE, etc.)
- **Automatic abbreviation** for unmapped exchanges (first letters)
- **Consistent formatting** across all filter buttons

### Enhanced Styling
- **Improved button design** with better spacing and colors
- **Flag + text layout** with proper alignment
- **Hover effects** and active states
- **Responsive design** for mobile devices

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- Updated `updateExchangeFilters()` method to fetch country data
- Added `getShortExchangeName()` method for name shortening
- Enhanced CSS styling for filter buttons
- Added comprehensive country flag mapping

### API Integration
- Uses existing `/api/v1/exchanges/` endpoint
- Leverages `country_name` field from database
- Maintains fallback behavior for API failures

### Database Support
- All exchange data includes country information
- 72+ exchanges with complete country mapping
- Regular updates from Financial Modeling Prep API

## Usage

The enhanced filters work automatically when users search for symbols. The system:

1. **Fetches exchange data** from the API
2. **Maps country names** to flag emojis
3. **Shortens exchange names** for better display
4. **Creates filter buttons** with flag + short name format
5. **Maintains functionality** with existing filtering logic

## Benefits
